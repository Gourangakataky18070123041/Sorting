# Sorting
## Aim:-
        To perform sorting of a rray
### Theory:-
             A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list elements according to a comparison operator on the elements.                The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of element in the respective data structure.
#### Algorithm:-
##### Conclusion:-
                    From this program we learnt how to perform diferrent types of sorting techniques to arrange a particular array in                           ascending or descending order.
